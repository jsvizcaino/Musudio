      <p>
          Hey there! I am a Guatemalan enrolled in the Texas A&amp;M MS in Analytics
           living it up in New Orleans. We've all found some extra time during
           Covid-19, and I've decided to refine a bit more my web editing
           skill by building this small website.
           <br></br>
           Saludos!
           <br>
           Vizca.
      </p>
